# GMail for Python

A Pythonic interface to Google's GMail, with all the tools you'll need. Search, 
read and send multipart emails, archive, mark as read/unread, delete emails, 
and manage labels.

__This library is still under development, so please forgive some of the rough edges__

Heavily inspired by [Kriss "nu7hatch" Kowalik's GMail for Ruby library](https://github.com/nu7hatch/gmail)

## Contributors

* [Reuben Castelino](https://github.com/projectdelphai) - Edited by me to work with python3

## Installation

For now, installation is manual (`pip` support not yet implemented) and the only requirement is to use Python 3

    git clone git://github.com/projectdelphai/gmail.git

## Features

* Search emails
* Read emails 
* Emails: label, archive, delete, mark as read/unread/spam, star
* Manage labels

## Basic usage

To start, import the `gmail` library.

    import gmail
    
### Authenticating gmail sessions

To easily get up and running:

    import gmail 

    g = gmail.login(username, password)

Which will automatically log you into a GMail account. 
This is actually a shortcut for creating a new Gmail object:
    
    from gmail import Gmail

    g = Gmail()
    g.login(username, password)
    # play with your gmail...
    g.logout()

You can also check if you are logged in at any time:

    g = gmail.login(username, password)
    g.logged_in # Should be True, AuthenticationError if login fails

### OAuth authentication 

If you have already received an [OAuth2 access token from Google](https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2) for a given user, you can easily log the user in. (Because OAuth 1.0 usage was deprecated in April 2012, this library does not currently support its usage)

    gmail = gmail.authenticate(username, access_token)

### Filtering emails
    
Get all messages in your inbox:

    g.inbox().mail()

Get messages that fit some criteria:

    g.inbox().mail(after=datetime.date(2013, 6, 18), before=datetime.date(2013, 8, 3))
    g.inbox().mail(on=datetime.date(2009, 1, 1)
    g.inbox().mail(sender="myfriend@gmail.com") # "from" is reserved, use "fr" or "sender"
    g.inbox().mail(to="directlytome@gmail.com")

Combine flags and options:

    g.inbox().mail(unread=True, sender="myboss@gmail.com")
    
Browsing labeled emails is similar to working with your inbox.

    g.mailbox('Urgent').mail()
    
Every message in a conversation/thread will come as a separate message.

    g.inbox().mail(unread=True, before=datetime.date(2013, 8, 3) sender="myboss@gmail.com")
    
### Working with emails

__Important: calls to `mail()` will return a list of empty email messages (with unique IDs). To work with labels, headers, subjects, and bodies, call `fetch()` on an individual message. You can call mail with `prefetch=True`, which will fetch the bodies automatically.__

    unread = g.inbox().mail(unread=True)
    print unread[0].body
    # None

    unread[0].fetch()
    print unread[0].body
    # Dear ...,

Mark news past a certain date as read and archive it:

    emails = g.inbox().mail(before=datetime.date(2013, 4, 18), sender="news@nbcnews.com")
    for email in emails:
        email.read() # can also unread(), delete(), spam(), or star()
        email.archive()

Delete all emails from a certain person:

    emails = g.inbox().mail(sender="junkmail@gmail.com")
    for email in emails:
        email.delete()
     
You can use also `label` method instead of `mailbox`: 

    g.label("Faxes").mail()

Add a label to a message:

    email.add_label("Faxes")

Download message attachments:

    for attachment in email.attachments:
        print 'Saving attachment: ' + attachment.name
        print 'Size: ' + str(attachment.size) + ' KB'
        attachment.save('attachments/' + attachment.name)
    
There is also few shortcuts to mark messages quickly:

    email.read()
    email.unread()
    email.spam()
    email.star()
    email.unstar()

### Roadmap
* Write tests
* Better label support
* Moving between labels/mailboxes
* Intuitive thread fetching & manipulation
* Sending mail via Google's SMTP servers (for now, check out https://github.com/paulchakravarti/gmail-sender)
